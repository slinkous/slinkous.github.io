## About

Hello, everyone! I am a software developer, teacher, and technical writer living in the Bay Area.

I first came to the Bay to take a course on Cognitive Linguistics at U.C. Berkeley that forever changed my understanding of how language lets us understand the world together. I think it is amazing that we can convey our deepest thoughts using a system of mouth grunts and scrawled lines.

### My Job

I am a Curriculum Developer for [MVCode](https://www.mvcode.com), where I write lessons and courses designed to introduce younger students to Computer Science in an engaging, project-based curriculum. I also teach classes and get to attend events related to our learning subjects.

I am also working on courses to complete the [UCSC Technical Writing and Communication Certificate Program](https://www.ucsc-extension.edu/certificate-program/design/technical-writing-and-communication), and taking parallel courses in [Computer Programming](https://www.ucsc-extension.edu/certificate-program/technology/computer-programming)

### My Hobby

In my free time, I play Roller Derby with the San Francisco Shevil Dead of [Bay Area Derby](http://www.bayareaderby.com). You can follow me as number 54 - Disastronaut!
