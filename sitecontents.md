## About

Hello, everyone! I am a software developer, teacher, and curriculum writer in the Bay Area.

I have lived all over the world, and first came here to take a course on Cognitive Linguistics at U.C. Berkeley that forever changed my understanding of how language lets us codify the world. I will forever be fascinated by human communication, that we can convey our most profound musings using a system of mouth noises, frequently transmitted by scrawled lines.

### My Job

I am the Lead Instructor at the original Mill Valley location of [MVCode Clubs](https://www.mvcode.com), where I write lessons and courses designed to introduce younger students to Computer Science in an engaging, project-based curriculum. I also teach classes and get to attend events related to our learning subjects.

### My Hobby

In my free time, I play Roller Derby with the San Francisco Shevil Dead of [Bay Area Derby](http://www.bayareaderby.com). You can follow me as number 54 - Disastronaut!
