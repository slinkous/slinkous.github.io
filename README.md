## Overview
This is a personal webpage, made to showcase my work as a Web Developer and Instructional Designer. It is also a sandbox for me to test out Web Development principles that I am currently studying.

## Sources
Currently, my study revolves around the requirements of the [Google Mobile Web Specialist]() certification, and the courses of the [Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree]() program. As a result, this page is often in a liminal state, and many of the design choices are about attempting a particular design, regardless of whether or not it is pleasing or necessary in this instance.

## Style Guide

I am relying primarily on the [Google HMTL and CSS style guide](), but have yet to implement most of it.

Notes from the online courses that I am using can also be found in the "Notes" folder.

## To-Do

Currently, I am studying Web Accessibility through this [Udacity Course](). My goals with this site on the short term are:

- Create drop-down navigation window for mobile viewport
- Improve image sizing on background and "About"
- Make "About" subsections text position over the images in a pleasing way.
- Use ``srcset``, ``sizes`` ``picture`` and ``source`` elements to create more responsive images
- Use fontawesome icons for social media links, and possibly nav bar subsections
- Add descriptions to Courses
- Add writing samples Projects
- Add alt text to relevant images

## Contributing

This is a personal project and as such I am not necessarily looking for collaborators. However, there are two very helpful ways to participate:

1. I am always open to code reviews, constructive criticism, and one-off tips
2. If you  know me and would like to endorse my skills, send me an e-mail or create a pull request! I would love to hear it.
